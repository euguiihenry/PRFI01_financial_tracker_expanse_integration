# PRFI01 - Financial Tracker - Expenses Integration

This repository is dedicated to the development of a Notion integration using Python. The main goal of this project is to facilitate the population of a Notion database using data from an Excel sheet. 

The integration will leverage the Python `requests` library to interact with the Notion API, and `openpyxl` or `pandas` for handling Excel files. The project will involve reading data from an Excel sheet, transforming it into a suitable format, and then using the Notion API to populate a Notion database.

The repository will contain the source code, unit tests, documentation, and any necessary resources for the project. It will be structured in a way that promotes clean, maintainable code, and will follow best practices for Python project structure.

The project is open to contributions, and any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
